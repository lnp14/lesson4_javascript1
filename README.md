### Project Description:
This assignment allowed us to begin learning and implementing the basics of JavaScript. We first added additional expense categories by utilizing id value and name value. We added new codes to recover the three variables from index.html and used the document.getElementById() method to assign the amounts to the variables. We then utilized the parseFloat() function to transform the user’s inputs from strings to floats. Next, we added coding to declare variables that store the calculated results. We then coded the calculations for the totalExpenses and percentages for each category. These results are allocated to the variables we created earlier. The getElementById() and toFixed() methods were used to display the total expenses and percentages for each category. Finally, the getElementById() was used to erase the expense percentage when a user clicks on the ‘Clear Form’ button.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that Java and JavaScript are two very different programs. Java programs are compiled and can be run as stand alone applications. It is a strongly-typed language and is a more complex programming language like C++. On the other hand, JavaScript programs are interpreted in the browser and are loosely-typed language.
2. I learned about four common methods of the window object, which include alert(), confirm(), prompt(), and print(). Alert()  and confirm() both display a message in a dialog box, but confirm() is a dialog box with two buttons: “OK” or “Cancel”. Prompt() displays a message that allows the user to enter a value and print() opens the Print Dialog Box to let the user select preferred printing options and prints the contents of the current window.
3. I learned about unary operators, which work on only one variable. There are prefix operators that are placed before a variable and postfix operators that are placed after a variable. They include increment (++), decrement (--), and negation (-) operators. An increment operator increases the value of a variable by 1, while decrement reduces the value by 1. Negation operator changes the sign of the variable.
